GITsync
===
Very straightforward backup solution for those who use git.


gitup
---
Watch the current directory for changes. Will commit and push everything. Just run it at the root of an existing git clone.


gitdown
---
Will regularly try to pull changes from remote git repository. Just run in at the root of your local clone.
